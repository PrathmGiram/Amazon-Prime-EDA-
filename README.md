# Goals:
The primary objective of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on the Amazon Prime dataset to gain insights into the streaming content available on the platform. By analyzing various attributes such as genres, release years, ratings, and more, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and interesting observations about the content library. This analysis can potentially help users discover new shows, understand content preferences, and aid decision-making for content acquisition and recommendation strategies.


# Analysis Techniques:
